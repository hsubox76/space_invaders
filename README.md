# space_invaders

Mary Rose Cook did a [30-minute live-coding demo](https://vimeo.com/105955605) where she built a
Space Invaders browser game with bare-bones JavaScript.

Here the code from that demo has been supplemented with:
* Different colors
* Start Game / Play Again buttons, with Game Over / Player Wins message
* Bullets can't destroy each other
* Limit player's firing rate
* Variation in invaders' color and design

To do:
* Instructions
* Scoring
